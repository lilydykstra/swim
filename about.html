<h2>About Lily</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Lily! As a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder studying Creative Technology and Design Engineering with a minor in Mathematics, I bring a unique blend of technical skills and creative passion to everything I do. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a strong commitment to water safety and enjoy sharing my skills through swim instruction and lifeguarding.</p>
    <p>My experience extends beyond the classroom and the pool. I've had the incredible opportunity to study abroad in Florence, Italy, further broadening my perspectives and inspiring my creative endeavors, which include sewing, sticker design, and embroidery.</p>
    <p>Whether you're looking to improve your swimming skills or need a responsible lifeguard for your event, I'm here to help. Let's make your aquatic experiences safe and enjoyable!</p>
