    <p>Hello! Happy to have you here :) <br> <br><b> Disclaimer: </b>I do not provide the pool. </p>
    <h2>SWIM LESSONS</h2>
    <p>I offer 30-60 min swim lessons for young kids. I recommend 30 min lessons for childrenâ€™s attention span and temperature regulation. For babies and younger toddlers, I focus on water acclimation and comfort. For older toddlers / younger children, I focus on survival swimming including what to do if you fall in the water, how to get to a wall, how to climb out when your feet cannot touch, etc.. I additional can evolve to more technique driven lessons for any age group as they learn the basics and advance to full on swimming. I will provide any gear used to facilitate learning.</p>

    <h2>LIFEGUARDING</h2>
    <p>I offer lifeguarding for private parties. Water safety is extremely important, especially when children are involved. I will come with my rescue kit containing: gloves, rescue breather, and first aid supplies. I only ask for a lookout perch / chair. </p>
